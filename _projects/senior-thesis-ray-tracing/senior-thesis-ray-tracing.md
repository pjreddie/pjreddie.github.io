title: "Senior Thesis: Ray Tracing"
description: "I researched ray tracing, its mathematical underpinnings and modern usage. I implemented a ray tracer in C++ that supported specular reflection, diffuse reflection, and transmission; general spectral distributions for light sources and reflectance curves for surfaces; and numerous shapes including triangles and general three dimensional quadric surfaces."

For my thesis in computer science, I researched ray tracing, its mathematical underpinnings and modern usage. I also implemented a ray tracer in C++ that supports...
